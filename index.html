               This web page is here to act as a deposit of information and images pertaining to a trip that was completed by a handful
               of travelers during one warm and honest American summer. The expedition took place during the months of June and July,
               which proved to be two months with temperatures assisting in creating an atmosphere that was all the more fitting 
               considering the location.

               We're talking about a location where the greens are shy and the sun is bold. We're talking about a place where rain is 
               scant and water is more appealing than gold. We're talking about a place where the horizon doesn't make it to the end of 
               the loneliness but still sits in great company. We're talking about the northern fourth of Arizona, USA.

               To specify further, some of the spots that this aforementioned group of travelers visited were the southern rim of the 
               Grand Canyon, a town named Page, and Powell Lake. The main takeaways from these three places follow:

            <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>A vast landscape that makes you feel real small, in a good way.</li>
               <li>Phenominal views begging for comprehension.</li>
               <li>Plenty of great hikes to take on (which have the potential of being dangerous if you aren't prepared).</li>
               <li>Lots of rocks, lots of dirt.</li>
            </ul>
         </article>
         <article>
            <h2>Page, AZ</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Small, neat town built near Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam. Has some good restaurants and all of the essentials.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Offers a good looking golf course, and also a &#34;deserty&#34; disc golf course (for those that prefer to 
                  throw things for fun as opposed to hitting things for fun).
               </li>
               <li>
                  If you're ever lucky enough to see the Road Runner from Looney Tunes in your lifetime, my guess is this would be the 
                  place.
               </li>
               <li>Lots of rocks, lots of dirt.</li>
            </ul>

         <article>
            <h2>Lake Powell</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Artificial lake that feeds into the Colorado River through the Glen Canyon Dam.</li>
               <li>Surrounded by super neat cliffs and plateaus.</li>
               <li>Perfectly good spot for cruising and hittin' some donuts on a Jet Ski.</li>
               <li>Lots of rocks, lots of water... and still lots of dirt.</li>
            </ul>
